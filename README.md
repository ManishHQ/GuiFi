🌊 GuiVerse — The Super App on GUI Chain
Prediction Markets • Vault Pools • Token Launches

GuiVerse is an all-in-one Web3 super app built on the GUI Chain, designed to empower communities with tools for prediction, pooling, and token creation — all under one decentralized roof.

🧩 Core Modules
🎯 Prediction Market

- Create & trade binary markets (Yes/No)
- Bet using GUI tokens
- 2.5% protocol fee on market resolution

Community-resolved outcomes (with revertible logic)

💰 Vaults & Liquidity Pools

- Permissionless staking vaults
- Token-paired liquidity pools
- Yield-earning & lock-based strategies (coming soon)

🚀 Token Launchpad

- Launch new tokens directly from GuiVerse
- Fair launch & presale pools
- Token+Market pairing for immediate prediction utility

🔧 Tech Stack

- 📝 Solidity – EVM Smart Contracts
- 💻 Next.js + TailwindCSS – Modern frontend
- 🔗 Ethers.js – Wallet & contract interaction
- 📦 Factory Pattern – Dynamic market/token/vault creation
- 💾 Optional: The Graph, IPFS, GUI Testnet

🔥 Why GuiVerse?
GuiVerse unifies speculation, liquidity, and tokenization. From degenerate predictions to community-powered token launches, everything happens permissionlessly, transparently, and fast.

No need to hop across dApps.
One interface. One chain. Full control.

📚 Coming Soon

- ERC-20 and LP token support
- DAO-based dispute resolution
- Cross-market statistics & leaderboards
- Gamified reputation scoring
- Mobile-first design (React Native / PWA)
